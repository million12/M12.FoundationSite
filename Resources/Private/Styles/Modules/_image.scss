// By default FIGURE has pretty large margin on left/right side
// Let's get rid of it for now. In plenty of cases there are
// some wrapping elements like grid, block grid, sliders
// which have their own spacing etc, therefore this one is not necessary.
figure {
	margin-left: 0;
	margin-right: 0;

// Paragraph inside FIGCAPTION: reset margin
figcaption {
	p { // don't use '> p' here! In Neos BE we have extra DIV around it, as it's editable
		margin: 0;
	}
}
